Apple claims&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/set-up-face-id-your-iphone-x-xs-xs-max-xr-0180120/\">Face ID</a>&nbsp;works at more angles than before in these models, which begs the question: can you unlock your iPhone when it's flat on a table?</p>\n<aside>\n<aside data-unit-type=\"rightbox\">\n</aside>\n</aside>\n<p>Overall, Face ID has been and is a great feature. That said, it can be frustrating when your iPhone is flat on a table and you want to check it quickly. With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/use-all-10-fingerprints-for-touch-id-your-iphone-not-just-5-them-0193777/\">Touch ID</a>, you don't need to move much &mdash; place your finger over the scanner, and your iPhone will unlock. Face ID, however, requires you to lean over your iPhone to authenticate yourself with the TrueDepth camera, which can be a bit of a pain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don't Miss:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/shoot-4k-with-selfie-camera-your-iphone-11-11-pro-11-pro-max-0206563/\">Shoot 4K Selfie Video on Your iPhone 11, 11 Pro &amp; 11 Pro Max</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, what's the verdict with the new iPhone models? Well, I can only speak to the 11 Pro I have in front of me, but since the 2019 variants all have the same front camera system, I feel confident in saying this:&nbsp;<strong>No, you can't unlock your iPhone when it's flat on a table.</strong></p>\n<p>In fact, I hardly notice a difference at all when it comes to the 11 Pro's supposedly higher range of Face ID angles. I put the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/collection/iphone-xs-tips-news/\">iPhone&nbsp;XS</a>&nbsp;in one hand and the 11 Pro in the other, and desperately tried to outmatch the older iPhone. Alas, the&nbsp;XS&nbsp;held its own, unlocking at virtually every angle the 11 Pro could.</p>\n<aside>\n<aside data-unit-type=\"rightbox\"></aside>\n</aside>\n<p>That conclusion is consistent with other reviewers of the new iPhone devices. Marques Brownlee, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyX-QZZBgpw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">expressed his disappointment</a>&nbsp;with the devices' inability to unlock from a flat position. He does confirm Apple's assertion that Face ID unlocks slightly faster than previous models &mdash; Apple claims up to 30% faster unlock speeds &mdash; but I haven't noticed a big difference.</p>\n<figure>\n<figure role=\"group\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<figure data-index=\"0\"><a href=\"https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/original/74/21/63705180488158/0/637051804881587421.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img src=\"https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/74/21/63705180488158/0/does-face-id-work-when-your-iphone-11-11-pro-11-pro-max-is-flat-table.w1456.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<figcaption>iPhone 11 Pro (left) vs. iPhone&nbsp;XS&nbsp;(right).<em>Image by Jake Peterson/Gadget Hacks</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<aside>\n<aside data-unit-type=\"rightbox\"></aside>\n</aside>\n<p>If your sole reason for upgrading your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/collection/iphone-x-tips-tricks/\">iPhone X</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/collection/iphone-xs-tips-news/\">XS</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/collection/iphone-xs-tips-news/\">XS&nbsp;Max</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ios.gadgethacks.com/collection/iphone-xr-tips-news/\">XR</a>&nbsp;to a new iPhone comes down to this question of unlocking, you're going to be let down.
